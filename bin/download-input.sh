# This script is used to download files of interest from GSE224292.
# The input files are bigWig files generated from RNA Polymerase II 
# Serine 5 Phosphorylation CUTAC-seq experiment on mouse embryonic
# stem cells. 

# The data shows open chromatin that is associated with RNA Pol II
# S5P binding. The data is from two types of cells: 
# - 2i (cells in a more na√Øve pluripotent state);
# - SL (a mix of cells in pluripotent and differentiating state).

# Define directory to store files:
input_dir="./inputs"
cd ${input_dir}

# Download input files
